### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Dylan, nice to meet you!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on : Currently I am working on my IOT pi management system for my "smart home" ESP and Pi projects including a security system that uses nginx streaming services and openCV along with discord and email bots to notify when the alarm goes off and a scale with scanner and upc lookup with esp camera boards in the kitchen to weigh pantry goods upon consumption to generate nutrition reports based on weight in food consumed. I am also re writing my React.js websites with TS and re-structuring them to be more secure.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning : To improve my webservices and how to properly and adequetly secure my webservices, this covers a lot of different technologies so its no small effort. I feel like I have learned enough stacks and I currently just plan on improving my skill in utilizing the tools I learned and applying the concepts and theories for code and service development rather than learning more tools.

  oh.. and.. I am also learning to be more consistant with my commits and posting my work after updating my code base locally.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on : My Karma project and my CreepCript projects would be amazing to get going again, currently re factoring the sites and backend for both using typescript, I am moving the projects from MongoDB to PostgreSQL and re developing the express I had been using to account for the database change and a lot of added security modifications to the user authentication systems and associated features. 

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with : Finding a Internship to get my foot in the door and transition from a job in IT to a job in development. If you know of any oppertunities at all please do let me know, I am confident in my ability to learn what is needed as it is needed and a shot at interview would mean the world even if it does not end in success the expierience would be an asset I can learn from.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about : Any of my projects or goals.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My email is dylanmanpoll@gmail.com, my website is https://devdylan.me you can also add me on discord : DevDylan#9707 or leave a message on the Django Blog page I made for a group I am trying to start up for people in Orlando Florida https://www.orlandocodecave.com, I plan on making massive upgrades to my sites in days to come.  

- âš¡ Fun fact: Development is my academic path, career goal, and hobby and love it.
